</p> -->
A general-purpose bot for Discord with the following commands:

**.iam** (role name): Assign yourself a role. If the role doesn't exist, it may be created depending on settings.

**.iamnot** (role name): Remove a role from your user. If no users have the role anymore, the role may be removed depending on settings.

**.meme**: Send a random meme, straight from our repositories.

**.song**: Send a random song from our list of boomer songs.

**@someone**: Randomly mention someone on the server.

**.prune** (amount) or **.prune** (user) (amount): Requires _Manage Messages_ permission. Delete messages from a channel, starting by the latest. If a user precedes the amount, delete messages from that user only.
Example: _.prune @a user I don't like 100_

All features can be enabled, disabled or customized with the help of _.enable,_ _.disable_ and _.set._ Additionally, the bot can welcome users and clean up unused roles, which may be coupled with the _.iam_ command for smoother role management.

The default dot prefix can be changed through _.set._
